# About me 
This will setup, using docker-compose, a basic Django + DRF + Vuejs project.

# First steps 
Start containers (in background, with `-d` is optionall):
  - `docker-compose up -d`

Create Django tables on DB:
  - `docker-compose run drf python manage.py migrate`

Create super user:
  - `docker-compose run drf python manage.py createsuperuser`

Start all containers:
  - `docker-compose up`

# Directory structure

  - File `docker-compose.yml`: Orchestrate all containers settings
  - Directory `dockerfiles`: 
    - File `drf`: Dockerfile to setup Django + DRF
    - File `vuejs`: Dockerfile to setup Vuejs + Webpack + NPM + etc...
  - Directory `logs`: Logs are saved here (container logs, or any log should be here)
  - File `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`: Pipenv files to install Django + DRF project, locally in your system.
  - File `README.md`: You are here :)
  - File `requirements.txt`: Requirements written here will be installed in the `drf` container. This file should be autogenerated by `pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt`, but you are free to set it by hand (at your own risk :-P) 
  - Directory `src`:
    - Directory `api`: Here is the Django + DRF project (the `backend`).
    - Drirectory `frontend`: Here is the Vuejs project.
