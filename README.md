# About me 
This will setup, using docker-compose, a basic Django + DRF + Vuejs `(vue-cli project)` project.

# First steps 
Start containers (in background, with `-d` is optionall):
  - `docker-compose up -d`

Create Django tables on DB:
  - `docker-compose run drf python manage.py migrate`

Create super user:
  - `docker-compose run drf python manage.py createsuperuser`

Start all containers:
  - `docker-compose up`

# Directory structure

  - File `docker-compose.yml`: Orchestrate all containers settings
  - Directory `dockerfiles`: 
    - File `drf`: Dockerfile to setup Django + DRF
    - File `vuejs`: Dockerfile to setup Vuejs + Webpack + NPM + etc...
  - Directory `logs`: Logs are saved here (container logs, or any log should be here)
  - File `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`: Pipenv files to install Django + DRF project, locally in your system.
  - File `README.md`: You are here :)
  - File `requirements.txt`: Requirements written here will be installed in the `drf` container. This file should be autogenerated by `pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt`, but you are free to set it by hand (at your own risk :-P) 
  - Directory `src`:
    - Directory `api`: Here is the Django + DRF project (the `backend`).
    - Drirectory `frontend`: Here is the Vuejs project.

# Code the backend

  - Install `pipenv` with your distro package manager, or as you prefer.
  - In the same directory where `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` exists, run: `pipenv install`
  - Done, now you are able to add your bugs at `src/api`

# Code the frontend
You need to have `vue-cli` installed. To install it follow this instructions:

  - Create a directory where `npm i -g ...` will be installed. Run: `mkdir ~/.npm-global`
  - Let `npm` where to find installed packages. Run: `npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'`
  - Let your `bash` knows where `excecutable` installed by `npm` are. Run: ` echo "export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc `. Apply changes made on `$PATH` running: `source ~/.bashrc`, or open a new terminal. 
  - Install `@vue-cli`, run: `npm install -g @vue/cli`
  - Install `@vue/cli-init`, run: `npm install -g @vue/cli-init`
