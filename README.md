# About me 
This will setup, using docker-compose, a basic Django + DRF + Vuejs `(vue-cli project)` project.

# Status:

- [x]  Ready to be used for development (hot reload, etc) 
- [ ]  Ready to be used on Production (nginx conf, prod settings, etc) 

# First steps 
Start containers (in background, with `-d` is optionall):
  - `docker-compose up -d`

Create Django tables on DB:
  - `docker-compose run drf python manage.py migrate`

Create super user:
  - `docker-compose run drf python manage.py createsuperuser`

Start all containers:
  - `docker-compose up`

# How to use it
First, be sure to complete `First steps` (describe above).
Then, after you start all containers (with `docker-compose up`, you are free to start coding the backend or frontend (the code will be auto-reloaded, both
the backend and frontend, each time you save the files in your editor).

# Directory structure

  - File `docker-compose.yml`: Orchestrate all containers settings
  - Directory `dockerfiles`: 
    - File `drf`: Dockerfile to setup Django + DRF
    - File `vuejs`: Dockerfile to setup Vuejs + Webpack + NPM + etc...
  - File `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`: Pipenv files to install Django + DRF project, locally in your system.
  - File `README.md`: You are here :)
  - File `requirements.txt`: Requirements written here will be installed in the `drf` container. This file should be autogenerated by `pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt`, but you are free to set it by hand (at your own risk :-P) 
  - Directory `src`:
    - Directory `api`: Here is the Django + DRF project (the `backend`).
    - Drirectory `frontend`: Here is the Vuejs project.

# Code the backend (with requirements installed in your HOST)

  - Install `pipenv` with your distro package manager, or as you prefer.
  - In the same directory where `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` exists, run: `pipenv install`
  - Done, now you are able to add your bugs at `src/api`

# Code the frontend (with requirements installed in your HOST)
You need to have `vue-cli` installed (if you already have it, omit this section). To install it follow this instructions:

  - Create a directory where `npm i -g ...` will be installed. Run: `mkdir ~/.npm-global`
  - Let `npm` where to find installed packages. Run: `npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'`
  - Let your `bash` knows where `excecutable` installed by `npm` are. Run: ` echo "export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc `. Apply changes made on `$PATH` running: `source ~/.bashrc`, or open a new terminal. 
  - Install `@vue-cli`, run: `npm install -g @vue/cli`
  - Install `@vue/cli-init`, run: `npm install -g @vue/cli-init`
